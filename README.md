# Conway's Game of Life

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project implements the famous "Game of Life" conjured by Cambridge mathematician John H Conway ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk&t=28s)) to simulate Darwin's Theory of Evolution, in a sense.

## Rules of Game of Life

The rules of the algorithm are simple:

1. "Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives."
2. "Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell."
3. "All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead."
